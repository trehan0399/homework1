What is a remote repository?

Answer: A remote repository in Git is a version-controlled repository hosted on a server, separate from a user's local machine. It allows multiple developers to collaborate by sharing and synchronizing their work, enabling them to push changes to and pull updates from a shared central location, ensuring a unified version of the project.
